# Introduction To Python
Welcome to this very short online course to introduce anyone and everyone to the fun of programming.
In this session, you will not need to to download anything or create an account.

Step 1:
Start by watching the video: it will teach you basic commands in python.
Click on "BriefIntroToPython.mp4". You may need to download the video onto your computer.
Or you can view the video online: https://youtu.be/RL9o8nsyYxQ

Step 2:
Then click on this link, and play around with what you have just learnt.
It is the online python interface introduced in the video tutorial.

Step 3:
If you get stuck or have trouble copying the code from the video, you can copy and paste the commands directly from the file: pythonScript.
Note that each line starting with "#" is a comment: you can write anything you want after a hashtag to structure and explain your code, without it being excuted in python.

Step 4:
Test your knowledge with this quiz of 10 questions.
It is okay to write the commands into python as you are doing the quiz.
